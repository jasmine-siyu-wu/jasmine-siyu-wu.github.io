Located in the Little Tokyo neighborhood in Downtown Los Angeles, the 0.87-acre, 200-meter Garden for Getting Lost is a linear park characterized by dualities like the Japanese-American experience. A constructed wetland sustained by gray water from the adjacent hotel makes its way through the site alongside a meandering landscape of drought tolerant native and naturalized plants. Meanwhile, two paths - the Tokyo Path and the Los Angeles Path - embodying two cultures winds its way through the landscape. Flowering, deciduous plants dominate the Tokyo Path while evergreen plants feature more prominently in the Los Angeles Paths.
